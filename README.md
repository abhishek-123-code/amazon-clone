# Amazon Demo (React)

This folder contains a small React scaffold created with Vite for classroom/demo use.

How to run (Windows PowerShell):

1. Open PowerShell in `d:\classroom\day13\amazon`
2. Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

3. Start dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Open the shown local URL (usually http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

Notes:
- This is a minimal scaffold. If you prefer Create React App, run `npx create-react-app my-app` instead.
- The project uses Vite. If you run into plugin errors, ensure `@vitejs/plugin-react` is installed (it is included in package.json devDependencies).
